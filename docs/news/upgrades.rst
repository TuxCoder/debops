Upgrade notes
=============

This document contains information and notes about any changes that are
required in the Ansible inventory or the IT infrastructure managed by DebOps to
perform the upgrades between different stable releases.


Unreleased
----------

Nothing new yet.


v0.7.0
------

This is mostly a maintenance release, dedicated to reorganization of the DebOps
:command:`git` repository and expanding documentation.

Role changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The :ref:`debops.nodejs` role now installs NPM using a script in upstream
  :command:`git` repository. This might cause issues with already installed NPM
  package, because of that it will be automatically removed by the role if
  found. You should verify that the role behaves correctly on existing systems
  before applying it in production.

- The :ref:`debops.gunicorn` role has rewritten configuration model based on
  :command:`systemd` instanced units. The existing configuration shouldn't
  interfere, however you might need to update the Ansible inventory
  configuration variables to the new syntax.

Inventory variable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The localization configuration previously located in the ``debops.console``
  role is now located in the :ref:`debops.locales` role. List of default
  variables that were affected:

  +-----------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
  | Old variable name           | New variable name               | Changed value |
  +=============================+=================================+===============+
  | ``console_locales``         | :envvar:`locales__default_list` | No            |
  +-----------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
  | ``console_locales_default`` | :envvar:`locales__system_lang`  | No            |
  +-----------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+

  There are also new localization variables for :envvar:`all hosts <locales__list>`,
  :envvar:`group of hosts <locales__group_list>`, :envvar:`specific hosts <locales__host_list>`
  and :envvar:`dependent roles <locales__dependent_list>`.

- The :file:`/etc/issue` and :file:`/etc/motd` configuration has been removed
  from the ``debops.console`` role and is now done by the :ref:`debops.machine`
  role. List of default variables that were affected:

  +-------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
  | Old variable name | New variable name               | Changed value |
  +===================+=================================+===============+
  | ``console_issue`` | :envvar:`machine__organization` | No            |
  +-------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
  | ``console_motd``  | :envvar:`machine__motd`         | No            |
  +-------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+

  The support for dynamic MOTD has been implemented by the :ref:`debops.machine`
  role, you might want to use that instead of the static MOTD file.

- Configuration of the ``/proc`` ``hidepid=`` option has been removed from the
  ``debops.console`` and is now available in the new :ref:`debops.proc_hidepid`
  Ansible role. List of default variables that were affected:

  +--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
  | Old variable name              | New variable name               | Changed value |
  +================================+=================================+===============+
  | ``console_proc_hidepid``       | :envvar:`proc_hidepid__enabled` | No            |
  +--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
  | ``console_proc_hidepid_level`` | :envvar:`proc_hidepid__level`   | No            |
  +--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
  | ``console_proc_hidepid_group`` | :envvar:`proc_hidepid__group`   | No            |
  +--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------+

  The logic to enable/disable the ``hidepid=`` configuration has been moved to
  the :envvar:`proc_hidepid__enabled` variable to be more accessible. The role
  creates its own set of Ansible local facts with new variable names, you might
  need to update configuration of the roles that relied on them.

- Configuration of the ``sysnews`` package has been removed from the
  ``debops.console`` role, it's now available in the :ref:`debops.sysnews`
  Ansible role. There were extensive changes in the variable names and
  parameters, read the documentation of the new role for details.


v0.6.0
------

This is an initial release based off of the previous DebOps roles, playbooks
and tools located in separate :command:`git` repositories. There should be no
changes needed between the old and the new infrastructure and inventory.
